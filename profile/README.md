## Overview

Chesstastic is a project by me, [Cormanz](https://github.com/Cormanz/Cormanz), with the goal of making chess variants more accessible. The end goal of the project is to create a website where users can do the following:

- Create their own chess variants with custom pieces, or choose from a selection of preexisting chess variants.
- Battle against other players in these chess variants.
- Battle against Lotisa, a chess engine made just for the Chesstastic project that supports a multitude of variants.
- Have games analyized by Lotisa, showing the best moves for any position in a given variant.
    - Enable a special analysis mode of Lotisa, weakening its ability to choose the best moves, but providing much more human-understandable commentary about moves.
